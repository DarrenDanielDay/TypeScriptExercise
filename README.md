# TypeScriptExercise

Just for TypeScript learning and type exercise.

## Quick Start

> NodeJS is required, and `yarn` is recommended.
> If you use the lint tool, `python` is required.

Run the following script:

```sh
yarn                # Install dependencies.
yarn start          # Run main.ts for demo.
```

Or if you do not have `yarn`:

```sh
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm run start       # Run main.ts for demo.
```
